1. Core Concepts:

	Sender and Receiver  : Simulate two entities exchanging data packets.
	Window Size          : Define the window size to control how many frames can be sent before needing an acknowledgment.
	Acknowledgments (ACK): Handle acknowledgment of received packets.
	Timers               : Manage timeouts for retransmission.
	Sequence Numbers     : Use sequence numbers to track sent and received frames.
    
2. Functional Requirements:

	Packet Handling:
		(i) Implement sending and receiving functions.
		(ii)Simulate packet loss or corruption (optional for testing).

	Flow Control: 
		Maintain the sliding window mechanism to ensure data consistency.

	Error Control:
		(i) Detect and recover from errors (e.g., using checksum or parity bit).
		(ii)Retransmit lost or corrupted frames.

	Timeout Management:
		Implement timers to handle unacknowledged frames.

3. C Language Concepts:

	Structures     : Use struct to define packets (e.g., data, sequence number, checksum).
	Multithreading : Simulate simultaneous sending and receiving.
	File I/O       : Save logs or read data for transmission.
	Dynamic Memory Allocation: Use malloc or arrays for buffer management.
	Sockets        : If simulating real network communication.

4. Algorithmic Steps:

	Initialization:
		(i) Set up sender and receiver buffers.
		(ii)Initialize variables like window size, sequence numbers, etc.

	Transmission Loop:
		(i)  Send packets within the window range.
		(ii) Wait for acknowledgments.
		(iii)Slide the window upon successful acknowledgment.

	Error Handling:
		(i) Resend frames if a timeout occurs.
		(ii)Handle duplicate or out-of-order acknowledgments.
	Termination:
		Stop when all packets are successfully transmitted and acknowledged.

5. Testing and Debugging:

	(i) Simulate normal conditions, packet loss, corruption, and duplicate acknowledgments.
	(ii)Log the transmission details for analysis.
